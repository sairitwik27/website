	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hi,I am Ritwik! I am a first year Masters in ECE student and my interests lie in Natural Language Processing,Speech Recognition and Computer Vision.
	I currently work in the AVA Lab under Prof Larry Heck as part of my VIP course and will soon start in summer as a research assistant in the same lab for the summer. 
	My current research interests are in the field of Embodied AI using commonsense reasoning from Large Language Models to create multimodal AI systems that have an open world cognition.
	I am a huge Interstellar fan, and I came into this field inspired by TARS and CASE. My long term research goal is to bring these fictional agents to reality.
